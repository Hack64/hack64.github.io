                    <p>I am a 21 years old IT Engineering student with a great passion for everything that involves a computer. I've recently got more involved in the great world of Open Source Software and I fell in love with it. In my free time I usually like coding or playing video games, mostly racing sims. I'm currently trying to learn ReactJS and Python, while also keeping my focus on improving my Java skills. I'm also a custom ROM maintainer for my mobile device.</p>
